STATISTICAL INFERENCE
making deductions, population is the whole package, you use samples to get info on the pop

Estimation: estimating the population mean through the sample mean (with an error), statistic info taken from the sample
- point est <- single number to use a population parameter
- interval est <- 2 values to estimate, a pop parameter is within that interval (with a level of confidence)

standard error:the smaller the sample you work with, the higher the error (standard dev/squared root of sample)
also, 1,96StandError gives you the confidence interval

HYpo testing: first, you need to define a few things
H0 <- null hypo, what would happen if your alternative hypo was FALSE
Ha <- alternative hypo, what you are testing for
test statistics <- es. p value
significance level <- what is the value from which I draw the threshold for the rejection on null hypo (usually 0,05)
it is your personal decision to put it this value

P-VALUE:
the percentage of risk you are willing to take in order to reject H0 (the lower, the less error you are willing to accept)

having a given distribution, everything that lies below the curve represents possible values for your z score.
In this way, given a certain z-score value you have  all the possible values that are above or below (??)

in the normal distribution in the slides: p-value is the proportion of values that are above my z-score 
probability because it is referring to the frequency in the whole population
so, you can say that it is a probability because it represents how much it is probable that I find
higher values than my z-score (if H0 was true, which is the risl that i prepare to accept)
